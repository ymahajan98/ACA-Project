This is an agent made to learn playing Atari Pong, which runs on the principles of Reinforcement Learning. The code is written in Python using OpenAI Gym.

The agent uses the technique of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to learn using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which uses off-policy Temporal Difference control, also known as Q-Learning, on a Model-free Markov Decision Process (MDP). A key part of DQNs is the use of Experience Replay and Fixed Targets, which is being used here to stabilize the CNN and help it to converge.
